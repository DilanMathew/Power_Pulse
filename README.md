**Overview**
PowerPulse is a machine learning project that predicts household energy consumption using historical power consumption data. The goal is to provide actionable insights for energy management, helping both consumers and energy providers optimize usage, reduce costs, and support sustainability initiatives.

This project demonstrates advanced techniques in data preprocessing, feature engineering, regression modeling, and visualization.

**Problem Statement**
In todayâ€™s world, accurate energy consumption forecasting is crucial for:

Reducing household energy bills.

Enabling energy providers to manage demand efficiently.

Supporting smart grid integration and sustainability goals.

This project builds predictive models to estimate Global Active Power consumption and identify key drivers of energy usage.
